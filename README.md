## Portfolio Projects
Cross-channel Marketing Campaign Optimization Projects

### Google Ecommerce Store Analysis
**Code:** [`Google_Ecommerce_Portfolio_Project.sql`](https://github.com/data-analysis-sarah-pena/SQL/blob/main/Google_Ecommerce_Portfolio_Project.sql)

**Description:** The dataset contains Google Analytics ecommerce data from a fictitious store. The dataset was created on Feb 25, 2022 and last modified on Sep 20, 2022 and is available through [Big Query public data](console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1sbigquery-public-data!2sthelook_ecommerce). The records include the tables of distribution centers, events, inventory items, order items, orders, products, and users. The project was done in a way that can be replicated for any ecommerce store to use. These metrics identify high and low value customers, segment customer behaviors, categorize customers by order value over specific durations, recognize frequent and substantial purchasers, and quantify KPIs for the creation of sales and marketing dashboards, ultimately contributing significantly to company revenue.   

**Skills:** hypothesis testing, filtering, aggregate functions, sorting, grouping, joining tables, data analysis

**Technology:** SQL Server

**Results:** Based on the experiment's findings, identifying the best-selling product would lead to revenue optimization by allowing businesses to focus their efforts on promoting and optimizing sales for that particular item, maximizing revenue generation. It would provide valuable insights into consumer preferences, tailor marketing efforts to highlight the most popular product, and attract more potential customers. Recognizing the top 10 customers by average order value (AOV) results in the potential to leverage high value customers for tailored targeted promotions, personalized offers, and incentives, increase the average transaction value, and reduce the likelihood of them switching to competitors. Targeting the top 100 customers with the highest lifetime value (LTV) would yield improvement in customer retention rates and referral opportunities. Segmenting customers by gender and purchase category would lead to increased conversion rates for targeted marketing campaigns, increasing the chances of upselling and cross-selling. Finally, analyzing total customer revenue customize promotions, offers, and communications based on the customer's spending behavior, increasing the likelihood of conversion and customer loyalty. These measures conclusively demonstrate how data-driven insights would foster company growth, amplified revenue, and optimize overall business performance.

### Sales Dashboard and Analysis
**Document:** [Sales Dashboard Portfolio Project](https://github.com/data-analysis-sarah-pena/Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Sales_Dashboard_Portfolio_Project.xlsm)

**Description:** A comprehensive Sales Dashboard that can be used as powerful tool to provide actionable insights for your business. Dynamic charts and visualizations can effortlessly track key performance metrics. Monitor "Sales by Year and Region" to grasp geographical trends, "Profit by Segment" to optimize customer targeting, and "Sales by Segment and Category" for a detailed product analysis. Dive deeper into regional data with "Sales and Profit by States," enabling localized strategies. Uncover logistical efficiency through "Quantity Sold by Sub-Category and Ship Mode," and fine-tune your inventory with "Sub-Category and Profit" data. Elevate your decision-making with a Sales Dashboard and maximize your business's growth potential.  

**Skills:** data aggregation, pivot tables, data visualization, chart customization, data analysis

**Technology:** Excel

**Results:** A thorough analysis of the sales dashboard reveals valuable insights that can drive strategic decisions and optimize business performance. The "Sales by Year and Region" chart highlights growth trends across different regions to help identify high-potential markets and allocate resources effectively. The "Profit by Segment" chart enables focus on the most profitable customer segments, tailoring marketing efforts and services to their specific needs. The "Sales by Segment and Category" chart uncovers product preferences within each segment, aiding in inventory management and marketing strategies. "Sales by States" and "Profit by States" charts pinpoint geographical areas of strength and weakness, aiding in targeted expansion and operational improvements. The "Quantity Sold by Sub-Category and Ship Mode" chart offers insights into shipping efficiency, while "Sub-Category and Profit" helps streamline the product portfolio for maximum profitability. Through these visualizations, our sales dashboard empowers data-driven decision-making across the organization, enhancing growth and customer satisfaction.

### B2B Marketing Strategy
**Document:** [`Mogul_B2B_Email_Strategy.pdf`](https://github.com/data-analysis-sarah-pena/Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Mogul_B2B_Email_Strategy.pdf)

**Description:** Mogul, a leading SaaS company specializing in global diversity recruitment, approached me to devise a strategic B2B Marketing Campaign aimed at generating leads, creating segmented email lists for automated flows, and establishing key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the campaign's success. In response, I crafted a comprehensive B2B email marketing strategy that delivered exceptional results. Through the implementation of metadata-based audience segmentation, which considered factors such as webpage clicks, browsing behavior, order history, and location, I optimized the email segments, campaigns and automated flows.   

**Skills:** segmentation, automation, meta-data extrapolation, data exploration, data cleaning, data management, data analysis

**Technology:** Powerpoint, Hubspot CRM

**Results:** We achieved impressive open rates, with engagement soaring to an average of 40% among highly targeted segments. Additionally, the click-through rates reached a remarkable 3%, while lead conversions surged to an outstanding 1.8%. This data-driven marketing approach not only fostered a 20% increase in website traffic but also yielded a notable 3% improvement in conversion rates within a span of six months. These remarkable outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness of this carefully structured B2B Marketing Campaign and its ability to drive substantial business growth.

**Description:** Explore a diverse range of email campaigns designed to engage, inspire, and convert.

The Free Giveaway email taps into the psychology of reciprocity and the joy of receiving. By offering something for free, we create a sense of goodwill and encourage recipients to engage with the email, social media, website and potentially convert into paying customers.

In the New Year Sale email, we leverage a visually appealing layout combined with compelling copy to emphasize exclusive discounts. This strategy is crafted to catch the recipient's attention and prompt them to explore the offerings, ultimately leading to increased sales.

The Product Survey email is strategically constructed to directly involve customers in shaping our future offerings. By demonstrating that we value their opinions, we foster a sense of ownership and loyalty, prompting them to participate and provide valuable feedback.

With the discount code email, we create a sense of urgency and exclusivity. By providing a unique code for savings, we entice recipients to take immediate action, as they want to benefit from the limited-time offer.

Our Cyber Week email employs dynamic visuals and concise messaging to capitalize on the urgency of time-limited deals. By creating a sense of FOMO (fear of missing out), we encourage recipients to seize the opportunity and make a purchase.

Finally, the Wishlist email acknowledges the importance of customer convenience. By allowing recipients to curate their personalized wishlist, we empower them to keep track of desired items and stay engaged with the brand.

Experience firsthand the intricacies of these email marketing strategies and witness their effectiveness in driving engagement and conversions.

By crafting compelling visuals and persuasive copy, we drove a surge in website traffic and a substantial increase in conversions, resulting in a highly successful sales event. Our offer of a free incentive cultivated unprecedented engagement, drawing in a significant number of new subscribers and fostering a deeper sense of brand loyalty among existing customers. Our proactive approach to gathering customer insights led to a wealth of valuable feedback, enabling us to refine our product offerings and enhance customer satisfaction. The employment of time-sensitive discount codes proved to be an irresistible incentive, generating an impressive spike in sales and establishing a sense of urgency among our customer base. Leveraging the hype of Cyber Week, we witnessed an extraordinary upswing in both website visits and conversions, achieving remarkable sales figures that far exceeded regular periods.
