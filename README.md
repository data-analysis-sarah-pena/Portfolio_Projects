## Portfolio Projects
Cross-channel Marketing Campaign Optimization Projects

### Google Ecommerce Store Analysis
**Code:** [`Google_Ecommerce_Portfolio_Project.sql`](https://github.com/data-analysis-sarah-pena/SQL/blob/main/Google_Ecommerce_Portfolio_Project.sql)

**Description:** The dataset contains Google Analytics ecommerce data from a fictitious store. The dataset was created on Feb 25, 2022 and last modified on Sep 20, 2022 and is available through [Big Query public data](console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1sbigquery-public-data!2sthelook_ecommerce). The records include the tables of distribution centers, events, inventory items, order items, orders, products, and users. The project was done in a way that can be replicated for any ecommerce store to use. These metrics identify high and low value customers, segment customer behaviors, categorize customers by order value over specific durations, recognize frequent and substantial purchasers, and quantify KPIs for the creation of sales and marketing dashboards, ultimately contributing significantly to company revenue.   

**Skills:** hypothesis testing, filtering, aggregate functions, sorting, grouping, joining tables, data analysis

**Technology:** SQL Server

**Results:** Based on the experiment's findings, identifying the best-selling product would lead to revenue optimization by allowing businesses to focus their efforts on promoting and optimizing sales for that particular item, maximizing revenue generation. It would provide valuable insights into consumer preferences, tailor marketing efforts to highlight the most popular product, and attract more potential customers. Recognizing the top 10 customers by average order value (AOV) results in the potential to leverage high value customers for tailored targeted promotions, personalized offers, and incentives, increase the average transaction value, and reduce the likelihood of them switching to competitors. Targeting the top 100 customers with the highest lifetime value (LTV) would yield improvement in customer retention rates and referral opportunities. Segmenting customers by gender and purchase category would lead to increased conversion rates for targeted marketing campaigns, increasing the chances of upselling and cross-selling. Finally, analyzing total customer revenue customize promotions, offers, and communications based on the customer's spending behavior, increasing the likelihood of conversion and customer loyalty. These measures conclusively demonstrate how data-driven insights would foster company growth, amplified revenue, and optimize overall business performance.

### B2B Marketing Strategy
**Document:** [`Mogul_B2B_Email_Strategy.pdf`](https://github.com/data-analysis-sarah-pena/Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Mogul_B2B_Email_Strategy.pdf)

**Description:** Mogul, a leading SaaS company specializing in global diversity recruitment, approached me to devise a strategic B2B Marketing Campaign aimed at generating leads, creating segmented email lists for automated flows, and establishing key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the campaign's success. In response, I crafted a comprehensive B2B email marketing strategy that delivered exceptional results. Through the implementation of metadata-based audience segmentation, which considered factors such as webpage clicks, browsing behavior, order history, and location, I optimized the email segments, campaigns and automated flows.   

**Skills:** segmentation, automation, meta-data extrapolation, data exploration, data cleaning, data management, data analysis

**Technology:** Powerpoint, Hubspot CRM

**Results:** We achieved impressive open rates, with engagement soaring to an average of 40% among highly targeted segments. Additionally, the click-through rates reached a remarkable 3%, while lead conversions surged to an outstanding 1.8%. This data-driven marketing approach not only fostered a 20% increase in website traffic but also yielded a notable 3% improvement in conversion rates within a span of six months. These remarkable outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness of this carefully structured B2B Marketing Campaign and its ability to drive substantial business growth.
